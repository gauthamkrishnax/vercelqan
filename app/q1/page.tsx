        Describe how you solved a challenge that one of your previous teams faced.
How did you determine your solution was successful?

        <p>
        As part of my role as a technical consultant at Adobe, I was involved in an ongoing project that necessitated the implementation of a multi-repo solution. The primary objective was to ensure clear separation of concerns between the middleware and frontend. However, the challenge arose when we needed to enhance the developer experience, particularly when multiple developers were simultaneously working on different repositories. The projectâ€™s complexity further escalated due to unforeseen technical difficulties,
          We had to maintain different repos for stage and production too. Especially when there are hot fixes or new features after live it was difficult to avoid conflicts. The solution that I formulated was to follow a reverse branching technique. Use cherry-pick to pick the hotfix commit and directly push to production and create a cross repo pull request from top production layer to the development layer. Applying this required high collaboration with other developers and the team and using this strategy we were successfully able to minimize the conflict and hence the time and effort required.
